                    <p>With more than 700 miles of hiking trails, the park offers endless opportunities for adventure, from scenic hikes and boating on alpine lakes to wildlife viewing and relaxing drives. Weâ€™re excited to experience its iconic glaciers, rugged peaks, and crystal-clear lakes during the summer months, which are the ideal time to visit.</p>
