            "Travel chaos, last-minute flights, late-night arrival, and huckleberry cinnamon rolls to start our adventure.<br><br>" +
            "Our Montana adventure started before sunrise. Sarah and I woke up at A 3:30am to discover that our United Airlines flight for 5:40am had been canceled. I took care of cancelling transportation to the airport, while Sarah rebooked with Delta for the same day: ORF (Norfolk) → ORD (Chicago), departing at 4:38pm.<br><br>" +
            "The new flight was already pushed back, landing at ORD (Detroit) later than the expected 7:00pm arrival. We had a tight connection to MSP (Minneapolis) to make the final leg to FCA (Kalispell). It felt like a race against the clock as we ran through the concourse, securing last-minute approval to board the connecting flight.<br><br>" +
            "Once in the air to Minneapolis, we received the news: our FCA (Kalispell) flight was delayed until the following day at the same time after being told that we would make it on time.<br><br>" +
            "The Father was looking out the entire time. After landing in Minneapolis, we sprinted to the boarding desk, explained our situation, and were escorted as close to the Concord entrance with quickly sprinting to the boarding desk. With just minutes to spare, we made it on the plane and were far ready to be on the last leg to Kalispell.<br><br>" +
            "💡 Insider Tip: When travel delays happen, stay calm, communicate with airline staff, and always have backup options for lodging and connections.<br><br>" +
            "[h3]Arrival[/h3]<br><br>" +
            "After a whirlwind of re-bookings, sprinting through airports, and last-minute boarding, we finally landed in FCA (Kalispell) close to midnight, which felt like 2:00am EST on our tired bodies. Exhaustion had set in, but the excitement of finally touching down in Montana kept us moving.<br><br>" +
            "Sarah headed straight to the Hertz rental desk while I went to grab our luggage. To my amazement, the bags appeared on the carousel within minutes and no long wait after a long day of travel. Once check-in was complete, we made our way to our ride for the week: a 2025 Nissan Altima. With luggage loaded and the GPS set, we pulled out of the airport and began the final stretch about 25 minutes north to Whitefish, where our Airbnb awaited.<br><br>"+
            "[img src=\"/blog/montana-huckleberry-cinnamon-rolls.webp\" alt=\"Huckleberry Cinnamon Rolls\" caption=\"Our Airbnb hosts welcomed us with homemade huckleberry cinnamon rolls.\" size=\"full\"]<br><br>" +
            "By the time we arrived at our Airbnb, we were exhausted, hungry, and ready to collapse. That's when we discovered one of the most awesome surprises of the trip. The property management had left us homemade huckleberry cinnamon rolls waiting on the counter. Starving, we ate just enough to save the rest for breakfast. With food in our stomachs at last, we unpacked the essentials and went straight to bed. Finally, in Montana and ready for the adventure to begin.<br><br>"+
            "💡 Insider Tip: Always pack a small snack or two for late-night arrivals since airport food is unreliable. And if you're lucky enough to find local treats waiting for you, don't pass them up. Huckleberries are a Montana specialty!<br><br>",
