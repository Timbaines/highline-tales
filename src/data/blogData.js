            "Our Montana adventure started before sunrise. Sarah and I woke up at A 3:30am to discover that our United Airlines flight for 5:40am had been canceled. I took care of cancelling transportation to the airport, while Sarah rebooked with Delta for the same day: ORF (Norfolk) → ORD (Chicago), departing at 4:38pm.<br><br>" +
            "The new flight was already pushed back, landing at ORD (Detroit) later than the expected 7:00pm arrival. We had a tight connection to MSP (Minneapolis) to make the final leg to FCA (Kalispell). It felt like a race against the clock as we ran through the concourse, securing last-minute approval to board the connecting flight.<br><br>" +
            "Once in the air to Minneapolis, we received the news: our FCA (Kalispell) flight was delayed until the following day at the same time after being told that we would make it on time.<br><br>" +
            "The Father was looking out the entire time. After landing in Minneapolis, we sprinted to the boarding desk, explained our situation, and were escorted as close to the Concord entrance with quickly sprinting to the boarding desk. With just minutes to spare, we made it on the plane and were far ready to be on the last leg to Kalispell.<br><br>" +

            "After a whirlwind of re-bookings, sprinting through airports, and last-minute boarding, we finally landed in FCA (Kalispell) close to midnight, which felt like 2:00am EST on our tired bodies. Exhaustion had set in, but the excitement of finally touching down in Montana kept us moving.<br><br>" +
            "Sarah headed straight to the Hertz rental desk while I went to grab our luggage. To my amazement, the bags appeared on the carousel within minutes and no long wait after a long day of travel. Once check-in was complete, we made our way to our ride for the week: a 2025 Nissan Altima. With luggage loaded and the GPS set, we pulled out of the airport and began the final stretch about 25 minutes north to Whitefish, where our Airbnb awaited.<br><br>"+

            "By the time we arrived at our Airbnb, we were exhausted, hungry, and ready to collapse. That's when we discovered one of the most awesome surprises of the trip. The property management had left us homemade huckleberry cinnamon rolls waiting on the counter. Starving, we ate just enough to save the rest for breakfast. With food in our stomachs at last, we unpacked the essentials and went straight to bed. Finally, in Montana and ready for the adventure to begin.<br><br>"+
            "💡 Insider Tip: Always pack a small snack or two for late-night arrivals since airport food is unreliable. And if you're lucky enough to find local treats waiting for you, don't pass them up. Huckleberries are a Montana specialty!<br><br>",

            "This day was all about tackling one of Glacier National Park's most iconic hikes, the Highline Trail. Known for its dramatic exposure, cliffside ledges, and sweeping alpine views, this trail is legendary among park visitors. Narrow paths hug sheer drop-offs, with a handrope bolted into the rock for'extra reassurance.

Along the way, we learned about the park's geology, wildlife, and cultural history, all while watching the scenery grow more dramatic with every switchback.<br><br>" +

            "Our guide for the day was Lauren Hibbard, whose background was as impressive as the surrounding mountains. She had worked across public, private, and outdoor education, even serving with the Montana Conservation Corps as a Crew Lead.

Lauren shared not just facts, but her love of teaching and being outdoors.<br><br>" +
            "The 7-mile hike itself was a full 8-hour adventure, filled with alpine meadows, rugged terrain, and jaw-dropping panoramas. Every turn of the trail revealed a new perspective with glacial valleys, jagged peaks, and wildflowers carpeting the slopes. By the end, we were tired, but it was the kind of exhaustion that comes from spending a day fully immersed in nature.<br><br>" +
            "💡 Insider Tip: If you're nervous about the Highline's exposure or want to dive deeper into the park's ecology and geology, book a guided hike with the Glacier Institute. Not only will you feel more confident on the trail, but you'll walk away with a much deeper appreciation of Glacier's landscapes.<br><br>" ,

            "We arrived at the West Entrance of the park earlier than needed for our scheduled 4:00pm boat tour. So instead of waiting around, we decided to make the most of the time by driving back through the park to the East Entrance and St. Mary's Lake. It gave us another chance to take in the Going-to-the-Sun and all of its incredible scenery from a different perspective. Heading in from the East is worth it just to experience the plains and see the mountain views from a distance.<br><br>" +
            "The 1.5-hour boat tour on St. Mary's Lake was a highlight. Our captain narrated as we cruised across the glacial waters, sharing stories of the park's history, geology, and wildlife.

The towering cedar and hemlock trees gave the area a mystical feel, with filtered light streaming through the dense canopy.<br><br>" +

The stage itself was unforgettable: a gutted Airstream camper converted into a music stage. That night's musician, Todd and the Drum, was a one-man powerhouse that sang, played guitar while using his legs to keep rhythm on the drums all at once.
