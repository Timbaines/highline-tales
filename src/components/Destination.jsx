            <h2>Destination</h2>
            <p>This years upcoming vacation destination is Montana, where Sarah and I will be staying in Whitefish and exploring the Glacier National Park. Spanning over more than 1 million acres, Glacier is the crown jewel of a vast protected wilderness shared by the U.S. and Canada.</p>

            <p>With more than 700 miles of hiking trails, the park offers endless opportunities for adventure, from scenic hikes and boating on alpine lakes to wildlife viewing and relaxing drives.</p>
